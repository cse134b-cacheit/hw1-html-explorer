				<h1>cacheIT HTML Exploration</h1>
				<p>This document explains the homework while containing basic examples of several HTML elements.</p> 
			</header>

			<div>
				<section>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This homework presents an opportunity to try out the large number of tags supported in HTML5.</p>

					<p>A few of the elements tested in this document, in the order they appear:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>head
						<li>header
						<li>section
						<li>figure
					</ol>

					<p>A few of the element tested in this document, not necessarily in the order they appear:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>p
						<li>h1
						<li>h2
						<li>link
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Specifics</h2>
					<p>The HTML5 specification is a sprawling document that includes both tags and related APIs. Sections 3 and 4 of the specification cover the document and the various elements you may use. In order to gain some familiarity with the spec we want you to read it over and create simple example(s) that demonstrate every element in a valid way.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<p>Do understand we are not expecting every aspect of every element to be tested as that would take a prohibitive amount of time.</p>
					</aside>

					<p>To test the elements you may make a single document or more likely a few documents. We would warn against making an individual document per element given the logistics of maintaining and linking all these files, but you may do so if you like.</p>

					<hr>

					<p>Test everything at <a href="http://validator.w3.org">w3 validator</a></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Docs</h2>
					<p>Put all your tests in a folder called tests and label them in a clear manner. Provide an index.html page where the grader should start the exploration of your work.
					</p>

					<pre>Test everything with
					Chrome
					Firefox
					IE
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Oddities</h2>
					<p>Once you have completed your test cases view the tests in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer and note non-supported elements or oddities you find. 
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"Yes, even if IE sucks."</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Summarize any issues you find in an HTML page named "conformance.html".</p>
