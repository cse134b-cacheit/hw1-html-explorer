		<p> Errors are discovered from www.c3.org: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Meters element, number must be double instead of time standard such as 00:00</li>
			<li> Form attribute, can't be nested within other</li>	
			<li> For attribute, extra closing tag of form</li>
			<li> Meters element, bar of green showed up in Internet Explorer</li>
			<li> The rb,rtc,and rp elements are not supported by browsers, and do not pass validation tests.</li>
			<li> rt works for internet exloprer and chrome as intended but doesn't work for firefox.</li>
			<li> bdi is not supported in all three browser, so throws warning while validating.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Regarding embedded content (4.7):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Plugins and supported file formats vary between browsers. For example, Java source code displays correctly in Chrome, but not in Firefox.</li>
			<li>Chrome supports WAV files, while Firefox requires Quicktime to run.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Regarding links (4.8):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For some reason, Chrome accepts the link to custom stylesheets, but Firefox doesn't. We have a custom stylesheet linked on our <a href="tests/links.html">Links page</a>, but Firefox doesn't pick it up. When we open the document inspector and import the style sheet directly, we get the expected result. Quite curious, indeed.
